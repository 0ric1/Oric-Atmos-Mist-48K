### How to view the photography on the MIST FPGA computer:

1. Download the files and prepare SD-Card as described in the [Oric_Mist_48K](https://github.com/rampa069/Oric_Mist_48K) repository.

2. Download the file(s) from this repository.

3. Copy the `dskcpc` folder to the prepared SD-Card.

4. Boot your MIST from the SD-Card and press `F12` to enter the `OSD Main Menu`.

5. In OSD enable `Oric Atmos` ROM and set `FDD controller` to `ON` (this has to be done only once).

6. In OSD select `Mount Drive A:*.dsk` and select a file from the `dskcpc` folder.

7. Press `F11`  (Reset) to reboot the system, you should see  a `SEDORIC V3.0` screen with a bunch of files, e.g. if you selected `LOTHRINGAIR_CPC.dsk` you should see e.g. `MIC.COM 8P`.

8. At the  prompt enter `LOAD"MIC"` and press the `ENTER` key to load the `MIC.COM` file.

9. You should see a photography ![MIC @ Lothirngair](assets/aSc_MICatLothringair.PNG)
